# Serial

## Introduction

### What's that

Serial is a reverse engineering challenge from SHARIF UNIVERSITY CTF 2016 worth 150 pts.
The goal of this challenge is to find the right serial number which will be the flag I guess.

Like:
```bash
./serial s0m3th!ng
>> Yeah you found the flag!
```

### Reverse engineering

I will be using:
- radare2
- angr
- Other standard tool for reverse engineering

First we are going to explore a bit into this binary.
To do that look into `explore.sh`, unfortunately the `flag` can't be found that easily.
We will need to do some analysis ...


### Sources

I chose this one because it had a lot of write ups including one with angr,
So it would be a good choice to practice with radare2 and angr with a chance of succeeding
while being a total beginner.

### References

Whenever you see something `0x45` it's an hexadecimal representation of a byte.

Register in memory:

| 8-byte register | Bytes 0-3 | Bytes 0-1 | Byte 0 |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| rax             | eax       | ax        | al     |

> When there's a `r` it is a register so 8 bytes, when it is a `e` it is bytes 0 to 3.

Commands in assembly:

- `lea <destination> <source>` : load source adress into destination
- `mov <destination> <source>` : Move source address into destination
mov     bx, 0C3EEh  ; Sign bit of bl is now 1: BH == 1100 0011, BL == 1110 1110
    movsx   ebx, bx     ; Load signed 16-bit value into 32-bit register and sign-extend
                        ; EBX is now equal FFFFC3EEh
    movzx   dx, bl      ; Load unsigned 8-bit value into 16-bit register and zero-extend
                        ; DX is now equal 00EEh

- `cmp <value1> <value2>` : Compare source value1 with value2
- `je <address>` : Jump to the specified address if the above comparison is equal
- `add <destination> <value>` : Add the value at the destination address value.

Common assembly registers:

- rax - register a extended (for data)
- rdi - register destination index (destination for data copies)

## Analysis

First we need to analyse with `aaa` with radare2.

### Radare2

That the time where we look at the disassembled main to understand what is happening.
Radare2 is very good at deciphering through the assembly instructions, 
you can have a look into `serial_disassembled.md` (We can view the disassembled view with `pdf @ main`) 

We can deduce that the variable s `rbp-0x200` is the entered input here. 
Shortly after that we can see that its length is checked `strlen`, the serial number should be 16 `0x10`.


```assembly
|           0x00400a19      488d8500feff.  lea rax, [s]                ; load rax with the value of s
|           0x00400a20      4889c7         mov rdi, rax                ; const char *s
|           0x00400a23      e828feffff     call sym.imp.strlen         ; size_t strlen(const char *s)
|           0x00400a28      4883f810       cmp rax, 0x10               ; compare with 16
|       ,=< 0x00400a2c      740e           je 0x400a3c                 ; jump when equal to 0x400a3c 
```


Then we can see that the first byte `al` of the input is compared with `E` (1 ASCII character is 8bits -> 1 byte).

```assembly
|       `-> 0x00400a3c      0fb68500feff.  movzx eax, byte [s]         ; Move the 4 bytes in memory in [s] into EAX
|           0x00400a43      3c45           cmp al, 0x45                ; compare the first byte with 'E' ; 69
|       ,=< 0x00400a45      740e           je 0x400a55                 ; jump when equal to 0x400a55
```

Then a hard coded value `var_1f1h` at `rbp-0x1f1` is added and the result is compared with the three first bytes of the input. 
So we can skip and try to find all of the easy constraints we can find. 
There are `16` hard coded values, so I guess each one is used to validate each character of the serial number.
Since the addition of the bytes for `E` and `var_1f1h` equals `155`, in ASCII that would mean `var_1f1h` equals `V` because `86 =155 - 69`

```assembly
|       `-> 0x00400a55      0fb68500feff.  movzx eax, byte [s]         ; Same as before
|           0x00400a5c      0fbed0         movsx edx, al               ; Move al to edx 
|           0x00400a5f      0fb6850ffeff.  movzx eax, byte [var_1f1h]  ; Move variable [var_1f1h] to eax
|           0x00400a66      0fbec0         movsx eax, al               ; Move al to eax
|           0x00400a69      01d0           add eax, edx                ; Add edx to eax
|           0x00400a6b      3d9b000000     cmp eax, 0x9b               ; compare eax with 155
|           0x00400a70      740e           je 0x400a80
```

Then we can see that the xth byte (hard coded value `[var_1ffh]`) should be a `Z`

```assembly
|           0x00400a7b      e9fb010000     jmp 0x400c7b
|           0x00400a80      0fb68501feff.  movzx eax, byte [var_1ffh]
|           0x00400a87      3c5a           cmp al, 0x5a                ; 'Z' ; 90
|       ,=< 0x00400a89      740e           je 0x400a99
```

Then there is another comparison with a hard coded value `[var_1f2h]`. So we have 90 + `?` = 155, so `A` at `0x65`.

```assembly
|       `-> 0x00400a99      0fb68501feff.  movzx eax, byte [var_1ffh]  ; Still contains Z
|           0x00400aa0      0fbed0         movsx edx, al               ; 'Z' ; 90
|           0x00400aa3      0fb6850efeff.  movzx eax, byte [var_1f2h]  ; Unknown hard coded value
|           0x00400aaa      0fbec0         movsx eax, al               ; first byte of that value
|           0x00400aad      01d0           add eax, edx                ; 90 + Unknown
|           0x00400aaf      3d9b000000     cmp eax, 0x9b               ; 155
```

Then it checks that the xth byte (hard coded value `[var_1feh]`) is a `9`

```assembly
|           0x00400ac4      0fb68502feff.  movzx eax, byte [var_1feh]
|           0x00400acb      3c39           cmp al, 0x39                ; '9' ; 57
|       ,=< 0x00400acd      740e           je 0x400add
```

So we can go on till the end we would find:
- a comparison between `155` and the addition of some hardcoded variable and the previous letter.
- a direct comparison between the next byte and a letter.

To sum up we should have these constraints:
- The length of the input must be 16
- str[0] = E
- str[15] = V
- str[1] = Z
- str[14] = A
- str[2] = 9
- ... 
- str[7] = c
- str[8] = 8

Which leads to the end at `EZ9dmq4c8g9G7bAV`

### Angr

With angr, what we want to achieve is arriving at the state where the serial number input is valid.
So in radare2 we can do `iz` which will give us the strings and their data location:

```assembly
[0x00400890]> iz
[Strings]
Num Paddr      Vaddr      Len Size Section  Type  String
000 0x00000dac 0x00400dac  28  29 (.rodata) ascii Please Enter the valid key!\n
001 0x00000dc9 0x00400dc9  26  27 (.rodata) ascii Serial number is valid :)\n
002 0x00000de4 0x00400de4  28  29 (.rodata) ascii Serial number is not valid!\n
```

Here we want to explore the binary until we arrive at `Serial number is valid :)\n` which is at the instruction line `0x00400c5c` (different from the data address).

```assembly
|      `--> 0x00400c5c      bec90d4000     mov esi, str.Serial_number_is_valid_: ; 0x400dc9 ; "Serial number is valid :)\n"
|           0x00400c61      bfe0136000     mov edi, obj.std::cout      ; 0x6013e0
```
